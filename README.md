# Cal Gas
A simple gas calculator to quickly see which gas station gives you the most bang for your buck. Because not all board prices are absolute!

---
Imagine yourself at 2 gas stations, ARCO and Exxon, side by side. On the boards, ARCO appears to have cheaper gas, but consider this: ARCO does not accept credit cards, so you either pay cash or debit card; if you pay with debit card, there is a 0.35 cents "debit card fee". Exxon, on the other hand, allows you to pay with credit card, which lets you earn up to 5% cashback depending on your credit card company. Potentially, with the extra fees and your credit card cashback, you might get a better deal at Exxon. But it is not always obvious and often tedious to calculate. Cal Gas provides just the solution to all your calculation woes.

Don’t believe me? Here’s a simple example for you. 

ARCO board price: 2.19/gallon. 
Exxon board price: 2.32/gallon. 

Let’s say your car has a gas tank of 15 gallons. If you pump ARCO with debit card, the total cost would be 2.19x15 + 0.35 = __$33.20__. If you pump Exxon with a credit card that gives you 5% cashback on gas, your total cost would be 2.32x15x0.95 = __$33.06__.
