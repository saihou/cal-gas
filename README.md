A gas calculator to quickly see which gas station gives you the most bang for your buck. Because not all board prices are absolute!

---
Imagine yourself at 2 gas stations, Arco and Exxon, side by side. On the boards, Arco appears to have cheaper gas, but consider this: Arco does not accept credit cards, so you  either pay cash or debit card; if you pay with debit card, there is a 0.35 cents "debit card fee". Exxon, on the other hand, allows you to pay with credit card, which potentially lets you earn up to 3% cashback depending on your credit card company. How do you reconcile that? Cal Gas provides the solution to all your calculation woes. 

Cal Gas. Because not all board prices are absolute. :)
